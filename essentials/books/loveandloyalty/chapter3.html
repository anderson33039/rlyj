        "So theres's a shining shimmering chick na nagpakita sa'yo and she said something about Antasha?" <br><br>

Isang babaeng mukhang 20 ang edad ang aking kausap ngayon sa aking bahay. Ito nga pala ang ate kong si Zayene, panganay na anak ng panglima kong tatay na mortal. She's a class B vampire which means a hybrid.<br><br>

"Ganon na nga ate. And it's 'Natasha', okay?" Saad ko at siningkit ang aking mga mata habang nag-iisip nang malalim. "Theres's something going on kay Kiyan these past few days."<br><br>

She's drinking a wine and suddenly stops after I talked about Kiyan. "Oh Kiyan? Who's that?" Tanong ni ate sakin.<br><br>

I responded with a cold reply. "Oh, he's a class A vampire like me. He have so many rage towards this shiny girl and I don't know why."<br><br>

"Hmm," She immediately grabbed her phone and flashed her screen to my face. "Oh my vamps! Have you ever heard about Ms. Blackfish's new released book?" She said with a happy tone.<br><br>

I smirked and rolled my eyes. "Who's that? Your favorite author?"<br><br>

"Well, yeah.  She's so good at writing so no wonder why she's so famous." She answered with a smile. <br><br>

"Well, sorry to interrupt your happiness but, wala talagang connect sa iniisip ko yan ngayon." Saad ko. <br><br>

She smirked and looked at my eyes. "Di mo sure. " She scrolled on her phone and shown me one of her favorite author's book— The Masked Ally. "Alam mo ba itong librong ito? " Tanong niya sakin.<br><br>

"Uh, yes? That's the book I always read when I am bored–"<br><br>

I totally remembered something. That book...<br><br>

[FLASHBACK]<br><br>

"Kung sino pa ang mabuti, sila pa ang nakakasama?" Pagtataka ko nang mabasa ko ito sa aking libro. 
<br><br>
"Are you wondering what does it mean?" Natatawang saad ni Natasha.<br><br>

"Yeah, this type of writers is my pet peeve talaga." Saad ko at napahawak sa sentido.<br><br>

Natasha stopped tapping her phone and looked at me curiously. "Bakit naman?"<br><br>

"Eh punyeta gusto ko lang naman magbasa eh. Is this a story book or a poetry?" Inis kong saad.<br><br>

She gave me a simple smile snd replied. "That is how authors or writers express their feelings. Hindi mo ba nasubukan na gawan ng tula si ate Zayene?" Tanong niya sakin.<br><br>

I took a deep breath before I respond. "Well, I did naman. Pero she laughed to it and told me na walang kabuhay-buhay yung tula ko."<br><br>

"Maybe kulang ka lang talaga sa expression, silly." She stood up and ruffled my hair and I gave him a dead stare.<br><br>

"You shouldn't do that."<br><br>

"Do what?"<br><br>

"Ginulo mo buhok ko!" I shouted and fixed my hair.<br><br>

She laughed and pinched my cheek. "The real meaning of that phrase is, not every good shits they give is true. Sometimes they... They use it to lure you to death."<br><br>

"As if they can? I am Zyro Hiroshi Villamore, and I am the strongest vampire in this world." Proudly said by me.<br><br>

She flicks my forehead and smiled. "With great power comes great reponsibilities." She sat on a sofa. "Every inch of you has a weakness."<br><br>

"You are. "<br><br>

[END OF FLASHBACK]<br><br>

"T-that is the book I always read." Saad ko. <br><br>

Hindi ko na namalayan na tumutulo na pala ang luha mula sa aking mga mata. Sobrang sakit at sobrang nsminiss ko na siya sa totoo lang.<br><br>

Ate Zayene sat besides me and gave me a hug. "I know, I am willing to help you. I feel like she's still alive."<br><br>

"In my heart." I put my hand on my chest.<br><br>

"No, in this world."<br><br>

I looked at her and raised my eyebrow. "What do you mean?"<br><br>

She stood up and crossed her arms. "I sensed her energy, fainting but I am positive that it's her energy."<br><br>

"Really?! Since when? Bakit di mo sinabi sakin kaagad?!" Sunod-sunod na pasigaw kong tanong.<br><br>

"Kung hindi ka nagdrama diyan edi sana nasabi ko na 'no." She replied and rolled her eyes. This girl, pasalamat s'ya kapatid ko s'ya.<br><br>

"Then let's go find her!"<br><br>

"Not the right time Zyro." She said in a cold tone.<br><br>

"What do you mean na hindi pa tamang oras?! Anong hinihintay natin? Bagong taon?!"<br><br>

"Pwede ba kumalma ka muna kahit na isang put*nginang minuto lang?!" She shouted and I paused for a second. "I'm sorry..." She said.<br><br>

"No, it's okay. You know, masyado lang akong nasasabik na makita ang minamahal ko." I said and I covered my face with my hand in frustration.<br><br>

"Hindi kasi s'ya nag-iisa." Saad nya at tumingin ako sakanya. "May malalakas na pwersa ng kadiliman ang nakapalibot." Dagdag niya.<br><br>

Bigla akong napaisip, masyado nga akong nagpapadalos-dalos. Masyado akong nadadala ng emosyon ko. Talagang nababaliw ako whenever Natsha is involved.<br><br>

I breath a sigh of relief and rests my back. "So what's the plan?"<br><br>

"Based on my sensations, we need more back-ups." She said and sat down on a couch. "They're too many, aabutin ng sampu o benteng class A vampires ang kakailanganin."<br><br>

"Ilan ba sila?" Tanong ko sakanya.<br><br>

She sighs and looked at me with her worried eyes.<br><br>

"I-isang libo..."<br><br>

===================<br><br>

"We still need to wait for the right time." She said. <br><br>

"Okay, okay." I replied.<br><br>

Just wait for us Natasha, mababawi rin kita at mananagot ang kumuha sa'yo.<br><br>

"I know the first vampire who could help us." Saad ko.<br><br>

"Who? That fool vampire behind that door? " Zayene teleported at the entrance and opened the door that cause Kiyan fall on the ground.<br><br>

"Oww..." Kiyan reacts in pain.<br><br>

"I knew you were listening this whole time." Saad ko at kinuha ang isang libro sa shelf sa tabi ng aking inuupuan para basahin.<br><br>

"Yeah, yeah, fine. I'm just watching over you. Baka kasi mapaano ka." Saad ni Kiyan.<br><br>

"So you are worried about my brother hmm." Sister said and sat on a couch. "Are you gay?"<br><br>

"No I am not." He replied.<br><br>

"But you are." Zayene replied.<br><br>

"Am not."<br><br>

"You are."<br><br>

"Am not!"<br><br>

"Can you guys please shut the fuck up?" I said and turned the page of the book that I'm reading. "Too much noise can cause avalanche."<br><br>

"Paano ka nga pala nagkaroon ng ate? Eh mas matanda ka pa nga diyan." Tanong ni Kiyan at nag crossed-arms.<br><br>

"I am 18 in disguise. She's 21." I replied while still reading a book.<br><br>

"21? Not bad." Kiyan replied and I closed the book.<br><br>

"One more step to my sister and I'll rip your face off." I said in a serious tone.<br><br>

"Woah hold on, daddy chill." Kiyan said.<br><br>

"Di ko alam na ang cold boy ay isang babaero pala." Zayene said and smirked.<br><br>

"I am not. Maiba ako, ano na plano mo ngayon Zyro?" Kiyan asked.<br><br>

"We'll find my cousins." I said and took the album on my left. "Irgus, Befriel, Reynon, and Astra."<br><br>

"Woah, ang cool n'yo pakinggan." Kiyan said.<br><br>

"Yeah, not until you put 'Zyro' sa simula." Zayene smirked and covered her mouth. "Pfft, Z. E. B. R. A."<br><br>

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ZEBRA— hell no I'm just joking!!" Kiyan cut his laughter after he saw the knife floating around his neck.<br><br>

"Tomorrow we'll find them and ask them to help us." I said and rests my back.<br><br>

"We need to take Natasha back."<br><br>
